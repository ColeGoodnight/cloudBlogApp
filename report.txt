DB/Auth strategy:
We chose to use postgres as the team has some prior experience with this 
database in production, as opposed to mysql. In addition we used sequelize
in place of mongoose in the original application, as this was an easier
transition to make compared to ditching the ORM concept entirely. In terms of
authentication, we chose to expand upon the functionality of the passport 
framework that was already implemented, this involved creating custom signup 
and signin strategies to accomodate our usage of sequelize. 

Challenges:
One of the hardest challenges was debugging passport authentication as it is
somewhat of a "black box" when it comes to error logging. Primarily stack 
overflow was used to figure out why we were getting the errors that we did,
eventually we found a post that contained the information that we needed to
enable more detailed error messages. When it came to figuring out the 
authentication initially there were several tutorials on integrating sequelize
with passport that were very helpful.
